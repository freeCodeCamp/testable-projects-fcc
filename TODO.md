# TODO:

- [ ] Create global, re-usable tests for D3 projects
- [ ] Add "click anywhere to close" utility function for the "pick test suite" menu
- [x] Add html copy for each project (explanation, links, user stories)
    - NOTE: Work on this has begun in the recently added `project_copy` directory
- [x] Replace all CDNs in example projects with production CDN (currently using dev link)
- [x] Calculator suite errors, write them - they don't seem to be present?
- [ ] Spaces after error messages
- [ ] User story punctuation - remove periods, looks better without them
- [ ] Add "click to hide" functionality for top-right corner indicator
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility? - Anis
- [ ] CSS specificity - prevent user CSS from interfering  
- [x] Get rid of X in test window - not needed, add margin to close button
- [ ] Disallow dropdown for example projects?
