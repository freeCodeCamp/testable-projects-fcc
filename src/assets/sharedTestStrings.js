export const responsiveWebDesignStack = '0. You can use HTML, JavaScript, ' +
  'and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that ' +
  'is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some practice ' +
  'with plain CSS. You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose. Additional ' +
  'technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not ' +
  'recommended for this project, and using them is at your own risk. ' +
  'Other projects will give you a chance to work with different technology ' +
  'stacks like React. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that ' +
  'use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!';
